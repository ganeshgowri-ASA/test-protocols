# LID-001: Light-Induced Degradation Test Protocol

## Overview

**Protocol ID:** LID-001
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Category:** Degradation
**Status:** Active

### Purpose

The LID-001 protocol evaluates Light-Induced Degradation (LID) in crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules. LID is an initial power loss that occurs when PV modules are first exposed to sunlight, primarily caused by the formation of boron-oxygen defect complexes in p-type silicon wafers.

### Applicable Standards

- IEC 61215-2:2021 (Clause 10.19) - Terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) modules - Design qualification and type approval - Part 2: Test procedures
- IEC 61215-1:2021 - Part 1: Test requirements
- IEC TS 63202-1:2019 - Photovoltaic cells - Part 1: Measurement of light-induced degradation

## Test Procedure

### 1. Pre-Test Conditioning

**Duration:** Minimum 12 hours

1. Store the module in complete darkness
2. Maintain room temperature (20-25°C)
3. Allow module to stabilize thermally and electrically

### 2. Initial Characterization

**Duration:** 1.5 hours

1. Perform three I-V measurements under Standard Test Conditions (STC):
   - Irradiance: 1000 W/m² ± 2%
   - Spectrum: AM1.5G
   - Module temperature: 25°C ± 2°C

2. Time interval between measurements: 30 minutes

3. Measure the following parameters:
   - Open-circuit voltage (Voc)
   - Short-circuit current (Isc)
   - Maximum power (Pmax)
   - Voltage at maximum power (Vmp)
   - Current at maximum power (Imp)
   - Fill factor (FF)

4. Calculate baseline power as the average of three Pmax measurements

### 3. Light Exposure Phase

**Duration:** 168 hours (7 days)

1. Subject module to continuous illumination:
   - Irradiance: 1000 W/m²
   - Spectrum: AM1.5G
   - Module temperature: 25°C ± 2°C

2. Perform I-V measurements at the following intervals:
   - 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
   - 1 hour
   - 2 hours
   - 4 hours
   - 8 hours
   - 24 hours (1 day)
   - 48 hours (2 days)
   - 72 hours (3 days)
   - 96 hours (4 days)
   - 120 hours (5 days)
   - 144 hours (6 days)
   - 168 hours (7 days)

3. For each measurement, record:
   - All electrical parameters (Voc, Isc, Pmax, Vmp, Imp, FF)
   - Environmental conditions (irradiance, temperature)
   - Timestamp and elapsed time
   - Operator and any observations

### 4. Post-Exposure Recovery (Optional)

**Duration:** 24 hours + measurement time

1. Store module in darkness for 24 hours at room temperature

2. Perform two I-V measurements at 1-hour intervals

3. Calculate recovery percentage:
   ```
   Recovery (%) = 100 × (P_recovered - P_degraded) / (P_initial - P_degraded)
   ```

## Calculations

### Power Degradation

The power degradation at each measurement point is calculated as:

```
ΔP(%) = 100 × (P_initial - P_current) / P_initial
```

Where:
- `P_initial` = Average of three initial Pmax measurements (baseline)
- `P_current` = Current Pmax measurement

### Fill Factor

```
FF = Pmax / (Voc × Isc)
```

### Stabilization Detection

Degradation is considered stabilized when the change in degradation between consecutive measurements falls below the threshold for N consecutive points:

```
|ΔP(t) - ΔP(t-1)| < 0.5% for 3 consecutive measurements
```

### Degradation Rate

Linear regression is applied to calculate the degradation rate:

```
rate (%/hour) = slope of ΔP vs. time
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Typical Degradation Range

For standard p-type crystalline silicon modules:
- **Typical:** 1.0% - 3.0%
- **Maximum allowable:** 5.0%

### Stabilization Criteria

- Change between consecutive measurements: < 0.5%
- Minimum consecutive stable points: 3
- Typical stabilization time: 48-96 hours

### Environmental Conditions Tolerance

- **Irradiance:** 1000 W/m² ± 2%
- **Temperature:** 25°C ± 2°C
- **Spectrum:** AM1.5G

### Measurement Uncertainty

- Maximum acceptable: 1.5%

## Quality Control

### Automated QC Checks

The system performs the following automated checks:

1. **Measurement Range Validation**
   - Voc: 0-100 V
   - Isc: 0-20 A
   - Pmax: 0-500 W
   - Fill Factor: 0.50-0.85

2. **Environmental Conditions**
   - Irradiance within ±2% of 1000 W/m²
   - Temperature within ±2°C of 25°C

3. **Data Completeness**
   - Minimum 95% of expected measurements
   - All required fields present

4. **Measurement Repeatability**
   - Coefficient of variation for initial measurements < 2%

5. **Degradation Limits**
   - Warning if degradation > 3%
   - Error if degradation > 5%

## Data Analysis

## Notes and Best Practices

### Module Types

- **P-type silicon:** Typically shows 1-3% LID
- **N-type silicon:** Usually exhibits < 1% LID
- **PERC cells:** May show 2-4% LID
- **Bifacial modules:** Test front side only unless specified

### Common Issues

1. **Temperature Control:** Critical for accurate results
   - Use active cooling system
   - Monitor continuously
   - Allow thermal stabilization between measurements

2. **Light Source Stability:**
   - Use class AAA solar simulator
   - Verify spectrum regularly
   - Monitor irradiance stability

3. **Measurement Timing:**
   - Be consistent with measurement intervals
   - Document any deviations
   - Avoid interrupting light exposure

### Recovery Testing

Some modules may show partial or full recovery after dark storage:
- Thermal annealing at 60°C can accelerate recovery
- Recovery indicates reversible boron-oxygen defects
- Permanent degradation indicates other mechanisms
